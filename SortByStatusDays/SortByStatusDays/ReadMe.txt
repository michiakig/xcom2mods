This mod changes the sorting method for the Armory's soldier list. Instead of sorting alphabetically by status, it sorts by number of days remaining until the soldier is available (either from healing or training),

This overrides the class UIPersonnel which means it's incompatible with at least one other mod, the "Order By Rank Class" mod.
