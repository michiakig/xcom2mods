proof of concept which empties a weapon of ammo if two conditions are met after a shot is taken:

* the shot misses
* an extra RNG roll fails

next steps:

* does this need to use interrupts any more?
* change animation to be without any bullets fired?
* "flyover" text
* implement using shot's original roll, as a "critical miss"
