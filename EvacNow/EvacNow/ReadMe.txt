This mod renders the evac zone target in yellow instead of blue if there are any soldiers who cannot reach the selected zone this turn.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

This overrides X2Actor_EvacZoneTarget so is not compatible with any mods which also override this class. At the moment I'm not aware of any mods which do, but if anyone knows any please post a comment.

It's also compatible with WOTC, even though the default launcher will flag it as incompatible.
