This mod allows you to selectively enable and disable the random posters that are auto-generated by the game.

[h1]Why?[/h1]

I really like the WOTC photobooth, however I find that the game creates so many random posters that the ones I personally choose to create get lost in a sea of auto-generated ones. This causes me to lose interest in the photobooth after a while and create fewer posters as the campaign goes on. By disabling the random posters, my hand-crafted posters are special again!

[h1]Options[/h1]

With Mod Config Menu, you can chose to enable or disable different types of posters. They're all disabled by default.
[list]
[*] Soldier KIA
[*] Soldier promoted
[*] Soldiers bonded
[*] Mission finished
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

The mod overrides the following classes:
[list]
[*] X2Photobooth_StrategyAutoGen
[*] X2Photobooth_TacticalAutoGen
[/list]

Unfortunately this means it's not compatible with the newly released Configurable Headshots mod. It may be possible to use these mods together and disable only mission posters, but I haven't tested that yet. I'm exploring alternatives.

[h1]Bugs/issues[/h1]

If you have the end-of-mission posters disabled and choose not to create one at the end of a mission, you will see the last poster created in the Skyranger return-to-base loading page, which will be a poster unrelated to the mission you just finished.
