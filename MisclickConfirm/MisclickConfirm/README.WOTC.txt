This mod adds a confirmation pop up whenever you order a soldier to move somewhere without cover, to prevent accidental misclicking ending your Ironman campaign.

The pop up is only shown under these circumstances:

- The move order ends out in the open and not in cover.
- The move order ends outside the evac zone.
- There are enemies visible to the currently selected unit.
- None of those enemies are Lost.

This version of the mod only works in WOTC. There's a vanilla version here:

Some improvements I'd like to make:

- Unfortunately, it overrides XComTacticalInput, so it's not compatible with mods which change camera behavior. Looking into alternatives
- Although the pop up is no longer shown every single time you move out of cover, I think it can still be made less annoying. Some ideas that were suggested that I may try to add include an override toggle and ignoring melee-only units

This is my first mod, so if you find bugs (sorry!) or if you have suggestions for how to improve it, please let me know in the comments!

Thanks to BlueRaja for posting code for the Confirm Free Reload mod, and to robojumper for help on the forums.
